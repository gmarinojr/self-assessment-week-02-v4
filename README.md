# Week 02 v4 Assessment

## Guidelines

Assessments are meant to give you and Hack Reactor staff an idea of how well you understand, or can figure out, the material that you covered recently.

- Turn off all communication devices such as your phone, email, Slack, etc.
- Fork this repo and clone down your fork to your laptop.
- Commit **working** code early and often (at least after every prompt). You are graded on your commit messages in addition to the code that you write

`[When this code is committed it will] Complete the basic-iteration prompt`

- Use the Chrome Console [Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/snippets) feature to author, test and debug your code before committing. An approved alternate tool is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). You are **NOT PERMITTED** to use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) to work on or complete this assessment.
- Do at least a little work on *every* prompt, even if you only leave comments that describe your intent. **Leaving a prompt blank is tantamount to failing a prompt. You'll get much more credit even for writing comments or pseudo-code that describe your intent**
- You **must** submit a pull request for all assessments **on time** (guidelines for how to submit a pull request are below). Give yourself several minutes to do this at the end of the time allotted for the assessment
- The help button is available to you during assessments, how often you use it is up to your own discretion
- After completing the assessment, if there are any prompts you felt you did not do well on, or, that you would not know how to assess whether or not you did well on, make plans to improve your skills on that topic **as soon as possible.**

## Using and Referencing Outside Resources

Each prompt contains a list of outside resources you are allowed to use to support your work on that prompt. Using *any* other resources, online or otherwise, including previous class materials, or, communicating through any mechanism with anyone other than Hack Reactor staff during the assessments is academic dishonesty and is cause for **immediate removal from the course.** If you have any questions about whether a resource is available for use, or if you are in need of support, submit a help request.

## Self-Grading Process

After you complete each prompt, assign a grade to each item in the Grading Outline, using the Grading Scale. Note your grade by editing **this file** (`README.md`), and writing your grade next to the corresponding item in the Grading Outline. Please use the exact terms shown in the Grading Scale; do not modify or improve them.

### Grading Outline

- [ ] algo-time-complexity
- [ ] js-inheritance-pseudo-classical-alt
- [ ] chat-client-fixme

### Grading Scale

Grade | Meaning
---|---
Complete             | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete      | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do *one* particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted            | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted        | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)

## Javascript Syntax Check

The file `syntaxalyze.html` is included. Open it in your browser and then drag your solution files onto the page to perform a syntax check. Fix any errors listed, then repeat the check. In order to re-check your file, you must **drag the solution file into syntaxalyze after each edit** &mdash; refreshing the page will not work. You may need to perform these steps multiple times until all the errors are fixed.

## Submitting Solutions

Solutions are submitted via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Follow these steps:

1. From **your fork**, select `Pull Requests` and then create a `New pull request`. 
2. STOP. *Before* you `Click to create a pull request for this comparison` you must **adjust the target branch** (aka `base branch`) to be your username. Once chagned, the pull-request heading should look like this:

  > hackreactor:username ... username:master

3. Copy and **paste the completed Grading Outline into the comment block** of your Pull Request.
4. Click `Send pull request`

**NOTE: Only submit one pull request per assessment.** You can feel free to continue working on the content and can submit another PR after our incredible Instruction Team has completed reviewing your work (which takes about a week), but submitting multiple PRs greatly complicates our review process and subverts our ability to observe your work in the context of specific time constraints.
