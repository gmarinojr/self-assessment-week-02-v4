## Chat Client
This repository is a chat-client like the one you built for Chatterbox Client. It has a (mostly) completed HTML/CSS user interface, but is missing a critical feature:

* [ ] Inside `js/setup.js`, locate the function responsible for sending messages to the server and write a comment to indicate your claim
* [ ] In the method that you identified, make it so that any message sent to the server appears in the chat log as soon as the client knows that the server successfully received them, rather than waiting for a refresh or the timed update

Note that this is an exercise in reading code and code reuse, so expect to spend most of your time figuring out where to make changes and try to write as little code as possible
